	<p> This is my son Milo. He is a black, white and beige Shetland Sheepdog of almost to years old and 
		pretty much the only thing that matters. He loves making friends with other dogs, kids and women but
		absolutely hates men and won't let them come near him.
	</p>

	<br> <!--break, separates the paragraphs-->

	<p> He's not much of a guard dog as he is scared of pretty much everything, but he does love his toys, belly 
		rubs and mangos (as you can see in the picture bellow, he would often steal mangos from our mango tree and we would
		find out by looking at his yellow paws).
	</p>
